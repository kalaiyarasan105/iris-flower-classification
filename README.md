🌼 Iris Flower Classification – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 1)
This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS.
It demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on four key features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🔍 One-Line Description
A beginner-friendly machine learning model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts the species of an iris flower using its petal and sepal measurements.

📌 Project Overview
This notebook-based project uses the well-known Iris Dataset to perform a supervised classification task.
It aims to classify iris flowers into one of the following three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The project includes data loading, exploration, visualization, model building, evaluation, and even a custom user input prediction feature!

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand basic classification concepts in Machine Learning

Load and manipulate datasets using pandas

Visualize patterns and distributions using matplotlib and seaborn

Train a classification model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like classification report and confusion matrix

Allow users to manually input measurements and predict flower species

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Google Colab	Interactive coding environment
Python	Core programming language
pandas, numpy	Data handling and numerical ops
seaborn, matplotlib	Data visualization
scikit-learn	ML models and evaluation tools

🧪 Sample User Inputs for Testing
Sepal Length	Sepal Width	Petal Length	Petal Width	Expected Species
5.1	3.5	1.4	0.2	Setosa 🌸
6.0	2.8	4.35	1.3	Versicolor 🌿
6.5	3.0	5.5	2.0	Virginica 🌺

✅ Features Implemented
✔️ Load and display the Iris dataset
✔️ Perform data exploration and visualization (pair plots, count plots, heatmaps)
✔️ Preprocess data and perform train-test split
✔️ Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model
✔️ Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
✔️ Enable user to manually input values and predict species dynamically

📎 How to Use This Notebook
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Run all the cells one by one

In the “User Input Section”, enter:

Sepal Length (e.g., 5.1)

Sepal Width (e.g., 3.5)

Petal Length (e.g., 1.4)

Petal Width (e.g., 0.2)

View the predicted species for your input

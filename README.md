🌼 Iris Flower Classification – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 1)

This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS.  
It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flower species based on four key features:  
Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

🔍 One-Line Description  
A beginner-friendly machine learning model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts the species of an iris flower from its petal and sepal measurements.

📌 Project Overview  
This notebook-based project uses the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate a basic classification task using supervised learning.  
The model classifies flowers into three species:

- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica

🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Understand basic classification using ML  
- Load and explore datasets using pandas  
- Visualize data using seaborn and matplotlib  
- Train a classification model using KNeighborsClassifier  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Allow users to manually input their own flower measurements and predict the species

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- Google Colab (Notebook)  
- Python  
- Libraries:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  

🧪 Sample User Inputs (for Testing Predictions)

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width | Expected Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | Setosa 🌸         |
| 6.0          | 2.8         | 4.35         | 1.3         | Versicolor 🌿     |
| 6.5          | 3.0         | 5.5          | 2.0         | Virginica 🌺      |

✅ Features Implemented  
- Load and display Iris dataset  
- Data exploration using visualizations (pair plots, count plots)  
- Data preprocessing and train/test split  
- K-Nearest Neighbors model training  
- Evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix  
- Custom user input support to predict flower species dynamically

📎 How to Use This Notebook  
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Run each cell step by step  
3. In the “User Input Section”, provide:
   - Sepal Length (e.g., 5.1)  
   - Sepal Width (e.g., 3.5)  
   - Petal Length (e.g., 1.4)  
   - Petal Width (e.g., 0.2)  
4. View the predicted species for the given inputs
